| Jan 9   |  9-9:55am   |                                                                            Coded dfs method recursively and the main findWords code. Still have to properly code the Trie and the isValidPrefix/isValidWord methods. |
| Jan 10  | 2:05-2:35pm | Coded Trie class, got everything working. Passing all test cases pretty quickly. Have to make some of the parameters instance variables, and Mr. Blick mentioned a way to speed up the checking valid prefix method. |
